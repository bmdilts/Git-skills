    <h1>Brandon Dilts</h1>
    <p>
      I was born in Columbus, IN. I grew up there and went to high school at Columbus North. I moved to Bloomington to attend Indiana University. I thought about doing software development when choosing majors in college (I should have!). I graduated with a degree in Political Science and worked in sales for 10 years. I was sooooo burnt out. I needed a change. I've always been excited about tech and software, now I get to create it and help move tech forward. I enjoy the puzzle solving aspects of coding. I enjoy creating something and using creativity to solve a problem. I'm excited to learn as much as possible at the Iron Yard.
